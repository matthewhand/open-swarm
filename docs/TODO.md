# Open Swarm Blueprint UX Enhancement Log

## What Has Been Tried So Far

### 1. Unified Spinner and Output Box Logic (All Blueprints)
- **Action:** Refactored all blueprints (DivineOps, FamilyTies, Chatbot, Codey, Geese, Jeeves, MonkaiMagic, RueCode, Suggestion, WhingeSurf, WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot, Gaggle) to use `get_spinner_state` and `print_operation_box` for all agent operations.
- **Result:** Successful. All blueprints now have consistent user feedback for input, result, and error states. Error handling is standardized. Spinner state is passed to all output boxes.

### 2. Custom Spinner Messages (MissionImprobable)
- **Action:** Implemented custom spinner messages (`Generating.`, `Generating..`, `Generating...`, `Running...`) and a logic to show `Generating... Taking longer than expected` if slow.
- **Result:** Successful. Custom spinner logic works as intended. Will generalize to more blueprints if required.

### 3. Enhanced ANSI/Emoji Boxes for Search/Analysis
- **Action:** Ensured all blueprints use enhanced output boxes for search/analysis, summarizing results, counts, and parameters. Added TODO markers for future detailed enhancements (e.g., MissionImprobable).
- **Result:** Partially complete. Some blueprints have TODOs for more advanced summary/progress features.

### 4. Audit Logging (Codey)
- **Action:** Added detailed audit logging for agent actions, reflections, and completions during test and normal runs.
- **Result:** Successful. Audit logs capture agent actions and reflections for later review.

## What Will Be Tried Next

1. **Generalize Custom Spinner Logic**
   - Refactor spinner logic (from MissionImprobable) into a utility so all blueprints can use advanced/custom spinner messages.
   - Apply to all blueprints for consistency.

2. **Full Implementation of Enhanced Search/Analysis Boxes**
   - Implement enhanced ANSI/emoji boxes for all search/analysis operations, including result counts, search params, and periodic progress updates.
   - Ensure clear distinction between code and semantic search output.

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Run `uv run pytest` to verify all blueprints pass tests with the new unified UX.
   - Document any failures and fixes.

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Update blueprint and framework docs to describe new UX patterns, spinner logic, and output conventions.

5. **Continuous Logging of Findings**
   - For every new enhancement or test, log findings and whether it was successful in this file.

*This log will be updated with every new attempt, result, and finding as the UX enhancement project continues.*
