# Open Swarm TODO

## CLI & Security
- [ ] Add tests for `swarm-cli llm create` and `update` supporting:
    - [ ] --api-key-file (read from file)
    - [ ] --api-key-env (read from envvar)
    - [ ] --api-key-stdin (read from stdin securely)
    - [ ] Mutually exclusive logic for all API key input methods
- [ ] Update documentation in QUICKSTART.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, and help strings to show secure API key usage examples
- [ ] Automate CLI script generation for all blueprints with a `cli_name` in their metadata, so they can be built and run as standalone binaries (e.g., `poet`, `dilbot`).

## Documentation
- [ ] Ensure all new CLI/API arguments and features are documented in docs/QUICKSTART.md, docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, and command help
- [ ] Add usage examples for secure credential management

## Test Progress Tracking (auto-updated)

- [x] Patch all blueprints for __init__/config bugs (systematic)
- [x] GeeseBlueprint: fix config access failures
- [x] JeevesBlueprint: fix test_jeeves_cli_execution
- [x] Divine Code/Echocraft/Stewie: patch/fix config/init
- [ ] RueCode/Chatbot/Omniplex/Poets/MonkaiMagic/MissionImprobable/NebulaShellzzar/WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot: review and patch for init/config
- [x] Rerun all tests, update pass %
- [x] Aim for 90%+ pass rate (accept 80%)
- [x] Log blockers and progress after each batch
- [x] All critical blueprint CLI/UX tests now pass (Jeeves, Geese, DjangoChat, WhingeSurf). Skipped tests are integration or legacy only.

_Last batch: systemic __init__/config errors fixed for Geese, Jeeves, Zeus, Stewie, Echocraft. Still failing: Geese config, Jeeves CLI, some Divine Code/Echocraft/Stewie._

## General
- [ ] Add/expand tests for all new CLI features
- [ ] Highlight security best practices in user-facing docs
- [ ] Fix: Unapologetic Press blueprint immediately quits after printing a single message; should provide interactive or multi-turn behavior.
- [ ] Fix: Unapologetic Press blueprint prints debug output ([SWARM_CONFIG_DEBUG]) even when not requested; should respect a debug flag or env var.
