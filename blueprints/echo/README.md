## Key Highlights

1. **Single Agent Simplicity**:
   - Includes a single agent with basic functionality.
   - Ideal for demonstrating the core functionality of Open Swarm MCP without additional complexity.

2. **Dynamic Tool Loading**:
   - Utilizes MCP server tools dynamically, based on runtime configurations.
   - This blueprint is not tied to specific tools, making it versatile for many scenarios.

3. **Baseline Implementation**:
   - A practical example of the `BlueprintBase` interface and how to implement its core methods.
   - Can be extended to include additional agents, tools, or specialized logic.
