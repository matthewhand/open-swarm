    Refactor blueprint framework and enhance interactive mode
    
    - Refactored `BlueprintBase` to include a standardized `interactive_mode` using `swarm.repl.run_demo_loop`, enabling consistent interactive behavior across all blueprints.
    - Added `get_agents` and `get_starting_agent` abstract methods to allow blueprint-specific agent selection logic, defaulting to random selection.
    - Simplified and cleaned up `DefaultBlueprint` by integrating logging and leveraging the updated `BlueprintBase` interactive mode.
    - Integrated `Swarm` client initialization and logging into `DefaultBlueprint` for improved debugging.
    - Updated `pyproject.toml` to include `pylint` for enhanced linting support.
    - Removed redundant and manual agent handling logic in favor of streamlined functions provided by the `BlueprintBase`.
    
    These changes improve maintainability, consistency, and extensibility of the blueprint system while aligning with the Swarm framework’s design philosophy.

    fix: ensure pytest-cov is installed and tests run with coverage
    
    - Added explicit installation of pytest and pytest-cov plugins in the GitHub Actions workflow.
    - Corrected the pytest command to use --cov flags with uv.
    - Ensured coverage reports (XML, JSON, and HTML) are generated and uploaded as artifacts.
    - Addressed issues where pytest was not recognizing --cov arguments due to missing plugin.

    Refactor agent_builder.py and main.py to align with Swarm SDK's function registration method
    
    - Updated agent_builder.py to pass tool functions directly to the Agent constructor using the 'functions' parameter.
    - Ensured all tool functions are synchronous and correctly proxy requests to MCP servers using the 'requests' library.
    - Modified main.py to remove 'await' from the build_agent_with_mcp_tools function call, preventing 'await' on non-awaitable Agent objects.
    - Enhanced error handling and logging for better debugging and stability.
    - Ensured that only asynchronous functions are awaited in main.py.
    - Updated documentation to reflect changes in agent building and execution flow.

    Refactor main.py to prioritize blueprint selection, improve logger setup, and enhance blueprint tests
    
    - Updated main.py to ensure blueprint selection occurs before agent initialization in CLI mode.
    - Improved logger configuration in utils/logger.py to allow for optional file logging and better handler management.
    - Enhanced test_blueprints.py with comprehensive tests for blueprint discovery and selection, including handling of invalid metadata and special characters.
    - Introduced the concept of Blueprints in README.md, explaining their purpose and structure.
    - Marked 'Setup Pytest for Blueprints' as completed in the TODO list of README.md.
